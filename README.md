Adaptation of the code originally developed as homework for Data Structures
## Overview:
The class GasStation, modeled after real life gas stations, provides you with a list of
methods regarding refilling your carâ€™s fuel tank and returning the total amount you have to pay
for the operation. It also provides the client with information about their current gas level and
price of gas at the gas station. With this program, you can:
- Completely or partially refuel the gas tank of your car in a way which prevents
overflow. After the operation is completed, the program informs you how much
you have to pay for it.
- Get information about the level of gas a user currently has, and what the full
capacity of their tank is.
- Get information about the gas price at the gas station
## Usage:
To use the GasStation class, you have to compile and run the code after downloading. To
do this, simply type in the terminal:
```
javac *.java
java GasStation value
```
Where value represents the price of gas at the gas station. value should be a real number greater
than 0. All subsequent operations of refueling depend on this value. It is of paramount
importance in returning to the user the amount they have to pay for buying a certain amount of
gallons of gas.
